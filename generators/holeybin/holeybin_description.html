<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The holey bin is a solid Gridfinity bin with a configurable grid of holes (round, hex, square, etc). Useful for
    things like a screw-bit organizer or battery-storage. You cannot specify the size of the bin. Instead, the
    generator will determine the minimum bin-size that fits the specified hole-grid</p>

<h5>Parameters</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Hole Grid: Width, Length and Height of the bin in grid units (42mm for Width and Length, 7mm for Height)</li>
    <li>Holes: Control whether magnet holes should be added, their size, and if additional holes for screws and/or
        magnet removal should be added as well</li>
    <li>Other: Select the output format (STL or STEP) and whether to include a stacking lip</li>
