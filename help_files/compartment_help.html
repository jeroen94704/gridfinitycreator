<p>Independent of the size of the bin you can specify into how many compartments the bin should be split. So you can have a 2x2 bin with 9, 8 or 36 compartments:</p>

<p>Note that there is a maximum to the number of compartments, which is determined by the size of your bin. You can create up to 3 compartments per unit-size in Width and Length. So a 2x2 bin can have at most 6x6 = 36 compartments, and a 1x2 bin can have at most 3x6 = 18 compartments</p>
