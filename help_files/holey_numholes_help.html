<p>The number of holes in the grid can be specified in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By setting the number of holes in the Width and Length directions</li>
  <li>By setting the bin-size in gridfinity units.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases the other quantity will be recalculated automatically. So as soon as you set a number of holes (either in Width or Length), the bin-size will be set to
the minimum size required to fit that number. As soon as you set a bin-size (either in Width or Length), the number of holes will be set to the maximum that fit in that
size bin. Combined with the keepout diameter this determines how big the bin will be.</p>

<p>Below you can see the result of increasing either the number of holes by 1 (bottom right), or setting the bin-Width to 2 (top right), while keeping all other
parameters unchanged from the original 4x4-hole bin (left):</p>
