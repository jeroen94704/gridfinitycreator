<p>The number of holes in Width and Length directions specify how many holes the grid consists of. Combined with the keepout diameter this determines how big the bin will be. The generator will create a bin of the minimum size required to fit the hole-grid</p>

<p>Here you can see the result of increasing the number of holes in one direction by 1, while keeping all other parameters unchanged:</p>

      In a future version you will optionally be able to specify the desired size of the bin and have the generator figure out how many holes fit in that size instead of the other way around.
