<p>The hole size controls the following dimensions for each hole shape:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Circles: the diameter of the holes.</li>
  <li>Hexagons: the inscribed diameter (that is, the distance between 2 corners).</li>
  <li>Squares: the length of the sides</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can see that the hole size does not immediately change the grid or the size of the bin because of the keepout diameter:</p>
