<p>Gridfinity bins can (optionally) be held in place on a base-plate using magnets. There are 2 options for this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Magnets are installed in the bottom of the bins and the base-plate has a suitable metal content (e.g. sheet metal)</li>
    <li>Magnets are part of the base-plate, and there are screws in the bottom of the bins</li>
</ul>

<p>To accomodate this, there are a few options to control the cutouts on the bottom of the bin:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Magnet holes: Controls whether magnet-sized holes are added to the bottom</li>
    <li>Magnet removal holes: If selected this adds smaller holes slightly offset from the main magnet holes. This allows easier removal of magnets, should this be necessary</li>
    <li>Screw holes: Controls whether screw holes are added to the bottom. Should be combined with the "Magnet holes" option to make room for a screw-head</li>
    <li>Magnet-hole diameter: Controls how large the magnet holes are to accomodate different sizes. The GF default is 6.5mm</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a render of what different combinations of these options look like:</p>
