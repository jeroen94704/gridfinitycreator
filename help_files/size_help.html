<p>Bin size is defined in grid-units. For Width and Length, the grid size is 42mm, for height the grid-size is 7mm</p>

<p>Note that there are limits to the size of the bins you can generate. For Width and Height the maximum is 8 units (336mm), for Height the maximum is 12 (84mm). These limits exist mainly to protect the server (larger bins are slower to generate), and these sizes are the largest that fit on common 3D printer beds</p>
